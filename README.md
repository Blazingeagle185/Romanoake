This is the README for Romanoake 
Romanoake is a karaoke web application that uses Spotify API and Azure LLMs to deliver a karaoke experience beyond language boundaries. The application uses transliterated LRC files to provide romanized lyrics for any song on Spotify. It scores users using Spotify's API analysis to group timbre vectors and do vocal analysis based on the user's microphone input.
